  [AKS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine) is a toolset to provision self-managed Kubernetes clusters in Azure. Customers that want more control over their Kubernetes clusters can opt to use AKS Engine instead of AKS, for example for functionality that requires modifications to the Kubernetes master nodes.
